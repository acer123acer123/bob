This project was created because our local home school cooperative needed
a way to manage students, courses, registration, events, and other tasks.

There was nothing available that could perform all of these functions so 
this project was created.

In the "documents" folder are files that contain information about this project:

	- DatabaseSchema.pptx - PowerPoint of the original database schema. This
				is not updated but very close to accurate.

	- FRED_2_Presentation_Outline_2014.docx - A Word document that 
				provides an overview of what this application is
				and how it can be used. It was created for
				a user training session.

	- FRED_Administrative_Guide.doc - The administration guide for the application.

	- *PDF files - These are documents that walk a user through the most
			common functions of the site:  Family enrollment, 
			Adding a course, and New Family Registration


A demo of this application can be made available to you if necessary. Just email me at christopher.ryan@gmail.com

**** I COULD REALLY USE SOME HELP WITH THIS CODE ******
*******************************************************

If you find this application useful and are proficient in Django, I could really use some help with this code. You'll find that it is not efficient (I'm not a programmer) and I would really like to make it so. I'd also like to replace a few of the functions with AJAX and am struggling with how to best handle that.  

I would welcome help with:

	- Updating / creating additional documentation
	- Reviewing the code and maybe finding just one or two areas that
	  you would be intersted in modifying and making more efficient
	- Reviewing the database calls and modifying them to be more efficient
	- Reviewing the database schema and suggesting indexes and other hints
	  to make it run faster.
